Who survived Titanic?

  This time, I will analyze the film and the most shocking incident that many people remember, namely Titanic.
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner operated by the White Star Line, which unfortunately sank in the North Atlantic Ocean on April 15, 1912. This incident was even remade into a film led by James Cameron and published on January 5, 1998. It tells about seventeen-year-old Rose hails from an aristocratic family and is set to be married. But when she boards the Titanic, she meets Jack Dawson, an artist, and falls in love. 

  Despite how beautiful and emotional this film is and accompanied by a tragic romantic story, it demonstrates natureâ€™s terrifying and mystical power, killing more than 1500 people: 832 passengers and 685 crew members.
And the analysis this time, I will analyze the passengers of the titanic only and not the crew members. The questions that will be the main topics are:

Who died?

1. Women or men, who have a higher mortality rate? And why?
2. Which class has the higher mortality rate? And why?
3. Does traveling alone have a higher mortality rate? And why?
4. Does the origin of departure have any effect on mortality rates? And why?
5. Does age affect the mortality rate? And why?
6. Does the position you have affect the death rate? And why?
